# GSS utils

Shared data transformation utilities for GSS data.

### Known issues

#### vcrpy does not overwrite interactions

When running a test with `record-mode=all` e.g.
```shell script
 pipenv run behave -D record_mode=all --tags=-skip -n '[Name of test]' features/scrape.feature
```
the scrape.yml sections are not overwritten. Instead, new ones are appended.

**Workaround**:
After running the tests, use the `clean-fixtures.py` script to remove repeated interactions.
The run the same tests with `record-mode=none` to confirm they all pass.
```shell script
 pipenv run behave -D record_mode=none --tags=-skip -n '[Name of test]' features/scrape.feature
```
