        pmdcat:markdownDescription  "Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is cross-border investment made with the objective of establishing a lasting interest in the host economy. FDI is also defined by control relationships, where the direct investor (parent company) controls at least 10% of the voting power (ordinary shares) of the direct investment enterprise. These relationships can be measured in two directions:\n\n* outward: the direct investments of UK-resident companies in other countries\n* inward: the direct investments in the UK from non-resident companies\n\nThis dataset covers:\n\n* Investment of UK companies abroad (outward) and foreign companies into the UK (inward), including investment flows, positions and earnings, by country, component and industry.\n* Detailed inward and outward statistical tables are published with this bulletin.\n* These statistics are presented using the directional principle, as opposed to the asset and liability principle. Further information on the differences between these principles can be found here.\n* Estimates are net values from the perspective of the parent company (ie. the value of loans provided to the subsidiary by the parent, minus the value of loans provided to the parent by the subsidiary).\n* Statistics also report on the immediate investment rather than the ultimate controlling parent company or ultimate host country.\n\n\n**Aggregation**\n\nIndustry, geography and components\n\n**Classification**\n\nCompiled according to [OECD Benchmark Definition of Foreign Direct Investment](https://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/investmentstatisticsandanalysis/40193734.pdf).\n\n**Geographical coverage**\n\nWorldwide, broken down by individual country\n\n**Time period coverage**\n\nYearly data from 2009 - 2018\n\n**Data quality**\n\nPlease see the ONS website for information on [data quality](https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/business/businessinnovation/methodologies/foreigndirectinvestmentfdiqmi)\n\n\n**Related information**\n\n* An [ad hoc data](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/adhocs/009763foreigndirectinvestmentfditotalsforinwardandoutwardflowspositionsandearnings2016to2017) request provides more detail on FDI by country for 2016 and 2017\n* These statistics have been used in some of our ongoing analysis of FDI statistics: [UK Foreign direct investment, trends and analysis](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/articles/ukforeigndirectinvestmenttrendsandanalysis/previousReleases)\n* Equivalent tables using the [asset and liability principle](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/bulletins/foreigndirectinvestmentinvolvingukcompaniesassetandliability/previousReleases) are available in a separate statistical bulletin.\n* We have also completed some [international comparisons](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/articles/internationalperspectiveonukforeigndirectinvestmentfdi/previousReleases) of FDI results using [OECD statistics](https://stats.oecd.org/).\n* The asset and liability and directional measurement principles use the same FDI data to calculate those statistics; [an explanation of these calculations](https://www.slideshare.net/statisticsONS/foreign-direct-investment-measurement-principles-explained) is available.\n\n"^^<https://www.w3.org/ns/iana/media-types/text/markdown#Resource> ;
